  QUESTION # 1


Create
a C program that swaps the values of two integers using a user-defined
function, swapIntegers. The user inputs two integer values, and the program
uses the function to swap them. It should perform the swap, and display the
updated values.


 


QUESTION # 2


Write a
C program with a user-defined function calculate to perform basic arithmetic
operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The
program should take two numbers and an operation choice as input, and then use
the function to perform the operation.


 


QUESTION # 3

You are working on a text processing program. Create a C program that reads a
text input from the user and searches for a specific character (e.g., 'a')
within the text using the strchr function. Display the total count of
occurrences of the character in the input text.


 


QUESTION # 4


Your task is to create a C program that performs password length
validation and user authentication based on the given requirements below:


a)    
Prompts the user to enter a password.


b)    
Validates the entered password by checking if it is
at least 8 characters long.


c)    
If the password meets the length requirement, the
program should compare it to a stored password "Secure123."


d)    
If the
entered password matches the stored password, display "Login successful.
Welcome!" Otherwise, display "Login failed. Incorrect password."


 


QUESTION # 5


In this C program, you are tasked with creating a function
called decideCarUsage that helps users decide whether they should use their car
on a particular day of the week. Users provide the numeric part of their car's
number and the day of the week (1 to 7). The program applies a simple rule:
even-numbered cars should be used on even days, and odd-numbered cars on odd
days. The function returns 1 if the car should be used and 0 if it should not.


 


QUESTION # 6


You are given an array of integers. Write a C program that
defines a user-defined function processArray to calculate the sum, maximum, and
minimum values in the array. The program should take the array and its size as
parameters and use the function to compute these values.


Input:Array is [4, 8, 1, 15, 6]


Output:


Array Sum:
34


Maximum
Value: 15


Minimum Value: 1


 


QUESTION # 7


You are
developing a C program for a coffee shop that offers discounts based on
customer loyalty and purchase history. The program should work as follows:


The program
should have a user-defined function named calculateDiscount that takes two
parameters: the customer's total purchase amount and the number of times they
have visited the shop in the past month.


determine
the discount based on the following criteria:
If
the customer has visited the shop more than 10 times in the past month and
their total purchase amount is $50 or more, they get a 15% discount.
If
the customer has visited the shop more than 5 times in the past month and their
total purchase amount is $30 or more, they get a 10% discount.
For
all other customers, no discount is applied.
The function
should return the calculated discount amount.








In the main part of the program, prompt the user
to input their total purchase amount and the number of times they have visited
the shop. Call the calculateDiscount function to calculate the discount, and
display the discount amount to the user.</details>
