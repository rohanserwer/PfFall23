  <summary>Questions</summary>
  1. Take Two numbers from user and divide both numbers but do not use the division operator.
2. Given an array of integers of size N and an integer “d”, the task is to rotate the array elements to the
left by d positions. Note: Solve the question without declaring another array. (The input array itself
must be modified).
Input: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}, d = 2
Output: {3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1, 2}
3. Take a number from user and count the sum of their digits.
Input: 206
Output: 8
Input: 4569
Output: 24
4. Take a 2D array(Matrix) as input from user and check that array is symmetric or not. If array is
symmetric then print “Array is Symmetric” with array if not, then print “array is not symmetric” with
given array.
Note: A symmetric matrix is a matrix that is equal to its transpose. Where elements in first row are
equal to elements in first column and so on.
Formal Definition: Aij = Aji.

5. Print the following pattern on C console using functions and loops:
Note: Perform the above task using loops and functions

5. Take an array with N elements as input, and then output the frequency of each element present in the
array. Example:
Input: {2, 4, 2, 3, 5, 5, 4, 4}
Output:
Frequency of 2 = 2
Frequency of 4 = 3
Frequency of 3 = 1
Frequency of 5 = 2
6. Take 2 2x2 matrices as input in a 2D array. Then, multiply the 2 matrices and print the final output
matrix. Use the following image as a guide:

7. Take an array with N elements as input, and sort the array into ascending order and then print the
sorted version.
Input: {6, 3, 2, 7, 1, 5}
Output: {1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7}
8. Junaid wants to keep track of all mobile phone bills in his X company branches. Let Y be the number
of company mobile phones in each branch. Create a 2D array for bill amount, where keep track of
branch ID in row subscript, mobile phone IDs in column subscript. Ask users to enter a bill for all mobile
phones in all branches. Your program should print the following:
- Total bill for all branches
- Total bill for each branch
- Branch ID where maximum bill arrived
- Branch and Mobile Phone IDs where bill is highest of all mobile phones.

10. Given an unsorted array A of size N that contains only non-negative integers, find a continuous sub-
array which adds to a given number S. In case of multiple subarrays, return the subarray which comes

first on moving from left to right.
Input:
Enter Number S = 12
Array: {1, 2, 3, 7, 5}
Output:
The Elements from Index 1 to 3 when summed results in the output of 12.
11. You are given an n x n integer matrix grid. Generate a matrix “maxLocal” of size (n - 2) x (n - 2) such
that: maxLocal[i][j] is equal to the largest value of the 3 x 3 matrix in grid centered around row i + 1
and column j + 1.
In other words, we want to find the largest value in every contiguous 3x3 matrix in the grid.
Return the generated matrix.
