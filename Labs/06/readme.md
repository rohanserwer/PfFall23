## Rohan Serwer Lab 6: Loops and Arrays
<details>
  <summary>Questions</summary>
  
 Q1) Write a C Program that takes any number from the user and identifies if the number is a
perfect number or not.

  Q2) Write a program that will generate the Fibonacci series up to 10000. Also find the sum of the
generated Fibonacci numbers divisible by 3, 5 or 7 only.
An example of the Fibonacci series is: 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 25..........
Note: Do this task by using a for loop DO NOT use arrays for this.

Q3) Write a C Program to compute the LCM and GCD of two numbers.

Q4:Consider Two integers a and b taken as input from the user. Using Loops iterate the value of
a till the value of b.
If the value of a<=9 the output should correspond to the English representation of the
numbers i.e., 8=Eight, 9=Nine etc.
If the iteration exceeds 9 then the programs should print if the exceeded number is even or
odd.
Example:
Input= 8,11
Output= Eight, Nine, Even, Odd

Q5: Write a C program that produces the following output:

0 0 0 0

1 1

2 2 2 2

3 3

4 4 4 4

5 5

6 6 6 6

Note: Only use single loops (No Nested Loops)
